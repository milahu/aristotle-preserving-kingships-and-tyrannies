Chapter 11

Methods of preserving monarchies, with particular reference to tyranny

<details>
<summary>comment by the translator</summary>

Dealing next with ways of preventing revolution in monarchies,  
Aristotle again has much more to say about tyranny than about kingship,  
which being based on consent is much more stable.

Tyranny is based on force and, traditionally, maintained by force.

The other way for a tyrant to maintain his position is to cultivate certain  
features of kingship, which Aristotle enumerates at length.  
These 'two quite different methods by which tyrannies  
may be preserved' are well described by Newman (IV 448):  
'The two ways of preserving a tyranny differ in this: ...  
in the first it is taken for granted that the subjects of a  
tyrant are necessarily hostile to him and the aim is to  
make them unable to conspire against him ...  
whereas in the second the aim is to make the subjects of the tyrant  
indisposed to conspire against h im ...  
It may seem strange that Aristotle devotes so much  
attention to describing measures by which a tyrant could  
maintain his position, for obviously he disapproves of  
tyranny as such.

Yet we may suspect that the lonely figure  
of the tyrant exercised a certain fascination over him;  
and since he has described the means of preserving other constitutions,  
it is possible that a donnish rigour and desire  
for completeness of treatment led him to give an equal attention to tyranny.

His main reason, however, presumably appears in the closing words of the chapter: a tyrant  
who adopts certain features of kingship will be to that  
extent a less bad ruler - a tyrant still, to be sure, but perhaps a tolerable, 'half-good' tyrant.

Aristotle may have supposed that the chapter could serve the beneficent  
practical purpose of persuading at least some tyrants, in  
the interests of maintaining their position, to modify their  
rule in a desirable direction.

1313a18

As to the preservation of monarchies, the  
general principle of opposite causes still holds good, but  
special principles are applicable to each.

\(A\) Kingships are preserved by tending towards greater moderation.

The fewer those spheres of activity where a king's power is  
sovereign, the longer the regime will inevitably survive undiminished.

They themselves become less like masters,  
and more like their subjects in character, and therefore  
arouse less envy among them.

That is the secret of the  
long life of the Molossian kingdom;  
and as for the Lacedaemonian, we can first point to the reason that from the  
very start the ruling was divided between two Kings;  
secondly, Theopompus, in addition to other measures of  
moderation, instituted as a check the office of the Ephors.

This diminution of the royal power had in the long run  
the effect of strengthening the kingship, so in a sense  
Theopompus did not reduce it but increased it, as he  
himself is reported to have said in reply to his wife, when  
she asked if he was not ashamed to be passing the kingdom on to his sons  
in a lesser state than he had inherited it from his father.

"Certainly not," he replied, "the kingdom that I pass on is longer-lasting."

There are two quite opposed methods by which

\(B\) tyrannies are preserved.

I deal first with the traditional method,  
the principle followed by most tyrants in exercising their dominion.

Periander of Corinth is credited  
with having in troduced many of the ways of applying i t,  
but the Persian government offers many parallels.

Here belong all the old hints for the preservation  
(so far as possible) of tyranny:

\[1313b.1\]  
Lop off the eminent and get rid of men of independent spirit;

\[1313b.2\]  
Don't allow getting together in messes or clubs, or education or anything of that kind;  

\[1313b.3\]  
these are the breeding grounds of independence and confidence,  
two things which a tyrant must guard against;

\[1313b.4\]  
Do not allow schools or other gatherings where men pursue learning together,  
and do everything to ensure that people do not get to know each other well,  
for such knowledge increases mutual confidence;

\[1313b.5\]  
Keep the dwellers in the city always within view and  
require them to spend much time at the palace gates;  
their activities then will not be kept secret, and by constantly performing servile actions they will become used  
to having li ttle spirit of their own.'

\[1313b.6\]  
There are other precepts of tyranny of the same kind, all of them having the  
same effect, among the Persians and other non-Greeks.

\[1313b.7\]  
Similarly a tyrant should endeavour to keep himself aware of everything that is said or done among his subjects:  
he should have spies like the 'Tittle-Tattle Women' of Syracuse,  
or the Eavesdroppers whom Hiero used to send to any place where there was a meeting or gathering of people.

Men speak less freely for fear of such men, and  
if they do open their mouths, they are more likely to be detected.

\[1313b.8\]  
Another way is to stir up strife and set friends against friends,  
people against notables,  
and the rich against each other.

\[1313b.9\]  
It is also in the interests of a tyrant to make his subjects poor,  
so that he may be able to afford the cost of his bodyguard,  
while the people are so occupied with their daily tasks that they have no time for plotting.

As examples of such measures, all h aving the  
same effect - of keeping subjects perpetually at work and  
in poverty - we may mention the pyramids of Egypt, the  
numerous offerings made by the Cypselids, the buil ding  
of the temple of Zeus Olympius by the Peisistratidae,  
and some of the works at Samos, under Polycrates.

\[1313b.10\]  
Subjects are also kept poor by payment of taxes,  
as at Syracuse under Dionysius,8 where in five years the value of  
everything possessed was paid in.

\[1313b.11\]  
The tyrant is also very ready to make war;  
for this keeps his subjects occupied  
and in continued need of a leader.

Friends are a source of stability to a kingship, but not to a tyrant;  
it is part of his policy to mistrust them more than anyone, as having  
more than anyone the power to do what all the others merely wish.

The features of extreme democracy are also all  
characteristic of a tyrant's policy:

\[1313b.12\]  
the dominance of women in the home,

\[1313b.13\]  
and slack control of slaves.

The reason for both features is the same.

Tyrants expect in  
this way to get infonnation against the men, for women  
and slaves do not plot against tyrants: keep them satisfied  
and they must always be supporters of tyrannies - and of  
democracies, for the people too likes to be sole ruler.

So for this reason, the flatterer too is held in honour by both :  
in democracies, the popular leader, because he is the  
flatterer of the mob;  
at a tyrant's court, those who keep  
him company in an obsequious spirit, which is the function of flattery.

\[1314a\]  
This makes tyranny favour the baser sort,  
in the sense that a tyrant loves to be flattered, and no man  
of free spirit will oblige him.  
Respectable men give friendship, or at any rate refrain from flattery,  
and base men are useful for base deeds  
('nail on nail', as the saying goes).

The typical tyrant dislikes proud and freespirited people.

He regards himself as the only person  
entitled to those qualities;  
and anyone who shows a rival  
pride and a spirit of freedom destroys the supremacy and  
master-like character of the tyranny.

Thus the tyrant hates  
such people as destroyers of his rule.

He is also inclined to  
cultivate the company of foreigners and eat with them  
rather than with citizens of his own state;  
for the latter  
he sees as potential enemies, the former as not making  
rival claims.  
rp4ai2 All these and their like are marks of tyranny  
and ways of maintaining it;  
and they are utterly depraved.  
They may all be grouped under three heads, corresponding to tyranny's three aims, namely that its subjects shall  
(a) have little spirit of their own, (b) have no trust in each  
other, and (c) have no means of carrying out anything.

As  
to (a), the point is that resistance is not planned by puny  
spirits against anyone.

As to (b), no tyranny is ever brought  
low until a certain degree of mutual confidence is established;  
hence tyrants are hostile to respectable men, as  
being dangerous to their rule, not only because of their  
repugnance to being ruled as though by a master, but  
because they command confidence, both among themselves and others, and abstain from making accusations  
against each other or anybody else.

As to (c), no one  
attempts what is quite beyond his powers, so nobody  
attempts to destroy even a tyranny if the power to do so  
is not there.

These then are the three defini tive ends to  
which the tyrant's plans relate : all his acts might be referred to these three principles - he wants his subjects to  
have no mutual confidence, no power and little spirit.  
rp4a29 So much for one method of preserving tyrannies;  
the other requires care to be exercised in virtually  
the opposite direction.

To understand it, we take our cue  
from the destruction of kingships.

Just as one way of setting a kingdom on the road to destruction is to make its  
rule more tyrannical, so conversely it preserves a tyranny  
to make it more kingly, always guarding just one thing -  
the power of the ruler, power enabling him to govern not  
only those who wish him to but also those who do not.  
For if he abandons that, he abandons his whole position  
as tyrant.

This serves as his permanent fundamental principle;  
for the rest, in his every real or pretended act he  
must be adept at playing in the role of a king.

Thus in the first place he will appear to think  
of the general good;  
he will not spend large sums on  
giving bounties such as arouse the people's indignation,  
as when the gifts are extracted from their toil and labour,  
while he gives lavishly to his mistresses, to foreigners, and  
to his skilled craftsmen.

And in this connection he will  
render an account of his revenue and expendi ture - a  
practice adopted by some tyrants in the past.

Such a mode  
of administration will help him to look l ike a householdmanager11 and not a tyrant.

And he does not have to fear  
shortage of money, being sovereign over the state.

Indeed,  
if a ruler goes abroad much, it is actually more expedient  
for him to follow this policylll than to collect and leave  
behind a vast sum.

There will be less likelihood that those  
in charge of his finances will try to get the control of  
affairs into their own hands;  
and when tyrants are away  
they are more nervous about those in charge of their  
finances than about the citizens : the citizens go abroad  
with him, the financial officers remain behind.

Again,  
when he collects taxes or demands public services,13 it  
should appear that he is doing these things to further his  
management,u and for his military needs at a particular  
juncture;  
and generally he should make himself look like  
a guardian and steward not of his own resources but of  
the public's.  
IJI4br8 In his dealings he should always give the impression of dignity, 1 4 not of harshness, of being the kind of  
person who inspires not fear but respect in those who meet  
him.

This is not easy if he is readily despised.

Hence if  
he cannot manage to cultivate any of the other virtues,  
he should aim at least at valour in warfare, and establish  
for himself a mili tary reputation.

Neither he nor any of  
his entourage should be seen to violatel5 any of his youthful subjects, male or female;  
and this applies equally to  
the women of his court in their behaviour towards other  
women.

(Female sexual assaults15 too have often caused  
tyrannies to fall.) His behaviour must also be unlike that  
of some tyrants nowadays in regard to indulgence of the  
body : they start at dawn and continue for days on end,  
and even do so for the express purpose of letting others  
see their indulgence and marvel at how happy and  
supremely fortunate they are.

In such matters moderation  
is best, or at least to avoid indulgence in full view of  
others.

It is not the sober but the tipsy man who is easily  
got at and easily despised, not the wide-awake but the  
slumberer.

And he must do the opposite of practically  
all the things mentioned long before : 16 thus in the arrangement and adornment of the city he should be a  
trustee rather than a tyrant.  
I JI 4 b 38 In religion he should always be more obviously  
in earnest than anyone else, but not so as to give an impression of brainlessness.

Men are less fearful of being  
treated illegally by such a person, whom they regard as  
a religious man and one who pays regard to the gods;  
and  
they plot against him less if they believe that he has even  
the gods on his side.

Again, when any of his subjects show  
a marked capacity for anything, he should honour them  
so much that they come to believe that even by independent citizens they could not have been given greater  
honour.

Such honours he should bestow in person, leaving punishments to be imposed by others, whether officials  
or courts.

There is a protective principle here which  
applies equally to all kinds of monarchy - not to make  
any one m an great;  
if need be, let there be several (they  
will watch each other).

If in practice it is found necessary  
so to single out one man, let him not be one of bold  
character.

Such a character is always ready for the attack,  
whatever the business in hand.

And if it is decided to  
dismiss him from power, this should be done gradually :  
do not remove his whole competence at one blow.  
rp5ar4 He should abstain from all ill-treatment17 in  
all its forms, and two in particular - offences against the  
person and against youth.

This precaution must be taken  
especially in regard to ambitious men;  
for while the  
money-loving chiefly resent slights which affect their  
money, the ambitious and respectable resent attacks on  
their honour.

Hence either he must not employ such men  
or, if he inflicts punishment, it should obviously be inflicted in a fatherly spirit and not as a slight.

His liaisons  
with young persons should spring from love, not simply  
from the opportunities open to him;  
and generally any  
apparent diminution of honours should be bought off by  
greater ones bestowed.

Of all those who make attacks on  
a tyrant's life, the most to be watched and feared are  
those who reck nothing of their own life provided they  
can take his.

Therefore he should be wary of such men  
when they think that they are ill-used17 (themselves or the  
objects of their care).

When anger is the spring of their  
action men are unsparing of themselves.

As Heraclitus  
once said, 'Anger is a difficult enemy;  
he buys with his  
life.'18  
IJI5aJI Since states are made up of two seotions, those  
who have property and those who do not, both, if possible, ought to believe that they owe their safety to the  
regime, and neither ought to treat the other unjustly.

But  
whichever of the two sections is the more powerful, its  
members ought to be thoroughly embraced by the regime,  
so that, with this backing for his interests, the tyrant may  
be able to avoid the necessity of such measures as the  
liberation of slaves and the confiscation of arms.

For it is  
sufficient for the purpose of being stronger than his  
attackers if one or other of the two sections be added to  
his power.  
I JI 5a4o It would be superfluous to go into any further  
details about such matters.

The general purpose is clear :  
a tyrant should not appear l ike a tyrant in the eyes of his  
subjects, but like a k ing and a manager of a household;ll  
not a person who is out for h is own gain but as a trustee  
of the affairs of others, aiming not at a life of excess, but  
at one of moderation;  
and as someone who moreover  
makes friends with the notables but is also the people's  
leader.

If he acts thus, his rule is bound to be not only  
better and more enviable (he will not be hated and feared,  
and h is rule will be exercised over better men, not men  
reduced to impotent submission), but also more l asting;  
and he himself will have either the right disposition or at  
least a half-good disposition with respect to virtue, a man  
not wicked but half-wicked.
