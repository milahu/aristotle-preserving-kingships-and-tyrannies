Aristotle - Politics  
Translation by Benjamin Jowett  
Aristotle - Politics - Book V - Chapter 11: Preserving Kingships and Tyrannies

As to tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways.

One of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants  
administer their government.

Of such arts Periander of Corinth is said to have been the great master,  
and many similar devices may be gathered from the Persians  
in the administration of their government.

There are firstly the prescriptions mentioned some distance back,  
for the preservation of a tyranny,  
in so far as this is possible; viz.,

\[1313b.1\]  
that the tyrant should lop off those who are too high;  
he must put to death men of spirit;

\[1313b.2\]  
he must not allow common meals,  
clubs, education, and the like;

\[1313b.3\]  
he must be upon his guard against  
anything which is likely to inspire either courage or confidence  
among his subjects;

\[1313b.4\]  
he must prohibit literary assemblies or other  
meetings for discussion, and he must take every means to prevent  
people from knowing one another (for acquaintance begets mutual  
confidence).

\[1313b.5\]  
Further, he must compel all persons staying in the city to appear in  
public and live at his gates; then he will know what they are doing: if  
they are always kept under, they will learn to be humble.

\[1313b.6\]  
In short, he  
should practice these and the like Persian and barbaric arts, which  
all have the same object.

\[1313b.7\]  
A tyrant should also endeavor to know  
what each of his subjects says or does, and should employ spies,  
like the ‘female detectives’ at Syracuse, and the eavesdroppers  
whom Hiero was in the habit of sending to any place of resort or  
meeting; for the fear of informers prevents people from speaking  
their minds, and if they do, they are more easily found out.

\[1313b.8\]  
Another art of the tyrant is to sow quarrels among the citizens;  
friends should be embroiled with friends,  
the people with the notables,  
and the rich with one another.

\[1313b.9\]  
Also he should impoverish his subjects;  
he thus provides against the maintenance of a guard by the citizen  
and the people, having to keep hard at work, are prevented from conspiring.  
The Pyramids of Egypt afford an example of this policy;  
also the  
offerings of the family of Cypselus, and the building of the temple of  
Olympian Zeus by the Peisistratidae, and the great Polycratean  
monuments at Samos;  
all these works were alike intended to occupy  
the people and keep them poor.

\[1313b.10\]  
Another practice of tyrants is to  
multiply taxes, after the manner of Dionysius at Syracuse, who  
contrived that within five years his subjects should bring into the  
treasury their whole property.

\[1313b.11\]  
The tyrant is also fond of making war  
in order that his subjects may have something to do and be always  
in want of a leader. And whereas the power of a king is preserved by  
his friends, the characteristic of a tyrant is to distrust his friends,  
because he knows that all men want to overthrow him, and they  
above all have the power.  
Again, the evil practices of the last and worst form of democracy are  
all found in tyrannies.

\[1313b.12\]  
Such are the power given to women in their  
families in the hope that they will inform against their husbands,

\[1313b.13\]  
and the license which is allowed to slaves  
in order that they may betray their masters;  
for slaves and women do not conspire against tyrants;  
and they are of course friendly to tyrannies and also to democracies,  
since under them they have a good time.  
For the people too would fain be a monarch,  
and therefore by them, as well as by the tyrant,  
the flatterer is held in honor;  
in democracies he is the demagogue;  
and the tyrant also has those who associate with him in a humble spirit,  
which is a work of flattery.

\[1314a\]  
Hence tyrants are always fond of bad men,  
because they love to be flattered,  
but no man who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower  
himself by flattery;  
good men love others, or at any rate do not flatter them.

Aristotle - Politics - Book V - Chapter 11: Preserving Kingships and Tyrannies

CHAPTER XI

Monarchies, in a word, are preserved by means contrary to what I have  
already mentioned as the cause of their destruction;  
but to speak to  
each separately:  
the stability of a kingdom will depend upon the power  
of the king's being kept within moderate bounds;  
for by how much the  
less extensive his power is,  
by so much the longer will his government  
continue;  
for he will be less despotic and more upon an equality of  
condition with those he governs;  
who, on that account, will envy him  
the less.

It was on this account that the kingdom of the Molossi continued so  
long;  
and the Lacedaemonians from their government's being from the  
beginning divided into two parts, and also by the moderation  
introduced into the other parts of it by Theopompus, and his  
establishment of the ephori;  
for by taking something from the power he  
increased the duration of the kingdom, so that in some measure he made  
it not less, but bigger;  
as they say he replied to his wife, who asked  
him if he was not ashamed to deliver down his kingdom to his children  
reduced from what he received it from his ancestors? No, says he, I  
give it him more lasting.

Tyrannies are preserved two ways most  
opposite to each other,  
one of which is when the power is delegated  
from one to the other,  
and in this manner many tyrants govern in their  
states.

Report says that Periander founded many of these.  
There are  
also many of them to be met with amongst the Persians.  
What has been  
already mentioned is as conducive as anything can be to preserve a  
tyranny;

\[1313b.1\]  
namely, to keep down those who are of an aspiring  
disposition, to take off those who will not submit,

\[1313b.2\]  
to allow no public  
meals, no clubs, no education, nothing at all,

\[1313b.3\]  
but to guard against  
everything that gives rise to high spirits or mutual confidence;

\[1313b.4\]  
nor to suffer the learned meetings of those who are at leisure to hold  
conversation with each other; and to endeavour by every means possible  
to keep all the people strangers to each other; for knowledge  
increases mutual confidence;

\[1313b.5\]  
and to oblige all strangers to appear in  
public, and to live near the city-gate, that all their actions may be  
sufficiently seen; for those who are kept like slaves seldom entertain  
any noble thoughts:

\[1313b.6\]  
in short, to imitate everything which the Persians  
and barbarians do, for they all contribute to support slavery;

\[1313b.7\]  
and to endeavour to know what every one who is under their power does and  
says; and for this purpose to employ spies: such were those women whom  
the Syracusians called potagogides Hiero also used to send out  
listeners wherever there was any meeting or conversation;  
for the  
people dare not speak with freedom for fear of such persons;  
and if  
any one does, there is the less chance of its being concealed;

\[1313b.8\]  
and to  
endeavour that the whole community should mutually accuse and come to  
blows with each other, friend with friend, the commons with the  
nobles, and the rich with each other.

\[1313b.9\]  
It is also advantageous for a  
tyranny that all those who are under it should be oppressed with  
poverty, that they may not be able to compose a guard; and that, being  
employed in procuring their daily bread, they may have no leisure to  
conspire against their tyrants. The Pyramids of Egypt are a proof of  
this, and the votive edifices of the Cyposelidse, and the temple of  
Jupiter Olympus, built by the Pisistratidae, and the works of  
Polycrates at Samos;  
for all these produced one end, the keeping the people poor.

\[1313b.10\]  
It is necessary also to multiply taxes, as at Syracuse;  
where Dionysius in the space of five years collected all the private  
property of his subjects into his own coffers.

\[1313b.11\]  
A tyrant also should  
endeavour to engage his subjects in a war, that they may have  
employment and continually depend upon their general. A king is  
preserved by his friends, but a tyrant is of all persons the man who  
can place no confidence in friends, as every one has it in his desire  
and these chiefly in their power to destroy him. All these things also  
which are done in an extreme democracy should be done in a tyranny,

\[1313b.12\]  
as permitting great licentiousness to the women in the house, that they  
may reveal their husbands' secrets;

\[1313b.13\]  
and showing great indulgence to slaves also for the same reason;  
for slaves and women conspire not against tyrants:  
but when they are treated with kindness,  
both of them are abettors of tyrants,  
and extreme democracies also;  
and the people too in such a state desire to be despotic.  
For which reason flatterers are in repute in both these:  
the demagogue in the democracy,  
for he is the proper flatterer of the people;  
among tyrants, he who will servilely adapt himself to their humours;  
for this is the business of flatterers.

\[1314a\]  
And for this reason tyrants always love the worst of wretches,  
for they rejoice in being flattered,  
which no man of a liberal spirit will submit to;  
for they love the virtuous, but flatter none.
