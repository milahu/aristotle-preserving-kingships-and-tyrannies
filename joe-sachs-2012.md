Aristotle - Politics - Book V - Chapter 11: Preserving Kingships and Tyrannies

Chapter 11

And it is clear that, to put it simply,  
they are preserved by opposite causes,  
and that with kingships in particular,  
this is done by bringing them to a state of greater moderation.

For necessarily, the fewer things they have authority over,  
the longer time their rule as a whole remains in place.

For they become less like slavemasters and more equitable in their characters,  
and are less envied by those they rule.

This is the reason the kingship has lasted a long time among the Molossians,  
and also that of the Spartans,  
both because the office was divided into two parts from the beginning,  
and because Theopompus moderated it again,  
among other things by setting up the office of the ephors.

For by making a subtraction from its power he added time to the kingship,  
so that in a certain way he made it not lesser but greater.

And this is exactly the reply people say he made to his wife,  
when she asked if he was not ashamed to be passing on to his sons  
a lesser kingship than he inherited from his father.  
"No indeed," he said, "for I am passing on one that will last a longer time."

Tyrannies are preserved in two ways that are complete opposites.

One of these is the traditional method  
by which most tyrants maintain control of their rule.

People say that Periander of Corinth established many of these,  
but it is also possible that many things of the sort  
are taken over from the Persian empire.

They are the things that were mentioned some time ago  
as tending toward preservation of tyranny as much as possible,

\[1313b.1\]  
by cutting down those who stand out  
and getting rid of those with proud thoughts,

\[1313b.2\]  
and not allowing common meals, clubs, education,  
or anything else of that sort,

\[1313b.3\]  
but guarding against everything from which two things customarily come —  
pride and trust —

\[1313b.4\]  
and not letting there be any schools  
or other collegial gatherings for leisured pursuits,  
and doing everything  
that will keep all the people as unknown to one another as possible  
(since familiarity breeds a greater degree of mutual trust).

\[1313b.5\]  
Another measure is  
to require the townspeople to be always out in the open  
and spend their time near the palace gates  
(since in that way what they are doing  
would be least likely to go unnoticed,  
and they would get in the habit of thinking small  
as a result of always living like slaves).

\[1313b.6\]  
And as many other Persian and barbarian practices of that sort  
as there may be are tyrannical in character  
(since they all have the same power).

\[1313b.7\]  
Another is for there to be spies,  
to try to  
keep whatever any of his subjects happens to say or do from going unnoticed,  
such as the so-called talebearers in Syracuse,  
and those Hiero used to send out to listen in  
wherever any meeting or gathering would be taking place  
(for people speak less frankly when they fear creatures of that sort,  
and if they do speak frankly they are less likely to go unnoticed).

\[1313b.8\]  
Another measure is to stir up mutual slander and clashes  
of friends against friends,  
the populace against the prominent people,  
and the rich among themselves.

\[1313b.9\]  
It is also characteristic of tyrants to make their subjects poor,  
both so that they cannot maintain a militia,  
and so that they are too busy looking after daily needs  
to have free time to get into conspiracies.  
Examples of this may be found in  
the pyramids of Egypt, the monumental offerings of the Cypselids, the construction dedicated to Olympian Zeus by the  
Peisistratids, and Polycrates’ works among those at Samos  
(for these all produce the same effect: poverty and a lack  
of leisure among those who are ruled).

\[1313b.10\]  
Another tyrannical  
measure is the imposition of property taxes, as in Syracuse  
(for in five years in the time of Dionysius people ended up  
paying in their entire property).

\[1313b.11\]  
A tyrant is also a warmonger,  
so that people will be without leisure  
and be constantly in need of a leader.

And whereas kingship is preserved —  
by its friends,  
it is characteristic of a tyrant to distrust his friends most of all,  
because what everyone wants,  
they have the most power to carry out.

And all the things that happen in the last stage of democracy  
apply to tyranny as well:

\[1313b.12\]  
female control over households, to get them to denounce their husbands,

\[1313b.13\]  
and permissiveness toward slaves for the same purpose.  
For slaves and women do not get into plots against tyrants,  
and when things go well for them  
they are necessarily favorably disposed toward tyrannies,  
and democracies as well,  
since the populace also tends toward being a monarch.  
This is also why a valued person in both is the flatterer:  
in popular governments this is the demagogue,  
since a demagogue is a flatterer of the populace,  
and with tyrants it is those who hang around them  
in a self-abasing manner,  
which is how flattery works.

\[1314a\]  
And it is for this reason that tyranny is friendly to corrupt people,  
since tyrants enjoy being flattered,  
and this is something no one who thinks like a free person would do.  
Decent people are friends; in other words, they do not flatter.

And corrupt people are useful for corrupt employments —  
a nail hammered at a nail, as the proverb has it.

And it is characteristic of a tyrant to take no pleasure in anyone dignified or free.  
For the tyrant considers himself to be the only person of that sort,  
and anyone who matches him in dignity and carries himself like a free person  
robs tyranny of what is exceptional and masterful about it.  
So tyrants hate them as if they were overturning their rule.

And it is also characteristic of a tyrant to use foreigners instead of citizens  
as companions at their meals and pastimes,  
on the assumption that the latter are their enemies  
while the former will not oppose them.

These things and their like are characteristic of tyranny and are safeguards of its rule,  
and there is no sort of vileness they leave out.

One may say that they are all encompassed within three forms,  
for tyranny aims at three things.

One is for its subjects to think small,  
since a small-souled person would not plot against anyone.

A second is for them to distrust one another completely,  
since a tyranny cannot be overthrown until some people have trust among themselves.

And this is the reason tyrants make war on decent people as detrimental to their rule —  
not just because such people do not think they deserve to be ruled like slaves by a master,  
but also because they are trusted, among themselves and by others,  
and do not inform on their own kind

1314A

or anyone else.

And the third aim is a lack of power for action,  
since no one attempts impossible things, and hence no  
one overthrows a tyranny if the power to do so is not there.  
So the ultimate terms into which the intentions of tyrants  
are reducible are just these three, since one may trace every  
tyrannical measure back to these underlying purposes: making the  
people not trust one another, making them have no  
power, and making them think small.  
One means by which the preservation of tyrannies is carried out, then,  
is of the foregoing sort. But there is another way  
of taking care of it that is practically the opposite of the things  
that have been described. And it is possible to gather it from  
the way kingships are destroyed. For just as one means of destruction  
of kingship is to make its rule more tyrannical, by the  
same token, one means of preservation of tyranny is to make it  
more kingly, if the tyrant watches out for one thing only—his  
power—so that he can rule not only willing but also unwilling  
subjects, for if he lets go of that he also lets go of being a tyrant.  
But while this has to remain present as an underlying purpose,  
he should do some other things, and seem to do others, to play  
a kingly role in beautiful style. First of all, he should seem to be  
concerned about public funds, and not spend them on the sort  
of giveaways that most people are infuriated by when tyrants  
with sticky fingers take money from them, who do the work  
and bear the burdens, and give it lavishly to mistresses and  
foreigners and co-conspirators; he should render an account  
of what he takes and spends, which some tyrants have in fact  
done before now. For by administering things in this way, one  
might seem to be a household manager and not a tyrant. He  
need not be afraid of ever running out of money, since he has  
authority over the city. And this practice is also more advantageous  
to tyrants when they are away from home than to leave  
behind what they have gathered up, since the people standing  
guard would be less likely to seize power; when tyrants are out  
of the city, those on guard are more to be feared by them than  
the citizens, since the latter are out of the city with them, while  
the former remain behind. And next, he should make a display  
of collecting taxes and public service contributions for the sake  
of managing affairs and to use, if the need should ever arise, in  
times of war, and in all respects appear to be equipping himself  
as a guardian and treasurer of public and not of private funds.

1314B

176 Aristotle Politics  
And a tyrant should not appear harsh, but dignified, but  
still the sort of person who, while not feared by those encounter him, would be respected instead. This, however, is no easy  
thing to achieve if he is easily despised, which is why, even  
if he makes no effort in the direction of the other virtues, he  
ought to cultivate the military variety, and make a reputation  
of that sort for himself. And not only should he not be seen  
treating any of his subjects insolently, not even a young boy  
or girl, but neither should any other member of his circle. And  
the women of his household ought to behave the same way  
toward other women, since many tyrannies have also been destroyed by acts of insolence among women. And as far as the  
enjoyment of bodily pleasures is concerned, he ought to do the  
opposite of what some tyrants do now. For not only do they  
indulge in this right from morning on and nonstop for days on  
end, but they even want to be seen by others while acting this  
way so that people will admire them as happy and blessed. It  
would be best for him to be moderate in such matters, but failing that, he should at least avoid being seen by others. For it is  
not the sober and wakeful person who is easy to attack or easy  
to despise, but the one who is drunk and drowsy. What needs  
to be done is the opposite of practically everything that was  
said above. For he ought to equip and order his city as though  
he were a trustee and not a tyrant. In addition, he must always  
make a display of taking matters related to the gods exceptionally seriously. For people are less afraid of suffering any lawless treatment at the hands of such rulers if they consider them  
to be god-fearing and mindful of the divine powers, and they  
are less likely to plot against those they think have even the  
gods as allies. But he ought to appear that way without being  
silly about it.171  
Also, he ought to honor those who become good in  
any respect in such a way that they would not believe they  
could ever be more honored by citizens living freely under  
laws, and he should hand out such honors himself, but have  
punishments meted out by other officials and judges. But  
a common safeguard for every monarchy is not to make  
171 An example that Aristotle may have in mind is a stunt described by  
Herodotus (History, I, 60) as the “silliest thing by far” he had ever  
heard of. When Peisistratus was restored to his tyranny in Athens,  
a tall woman in armor rode into town in a chariot, with heralds announcing that Athena herself was bringing him back.

1315A

any one person great, or if any, then more than one, since  
they will keep an eye on one another. If he must after all  
make someone great, it should at least not be someone of  
bold character, for a character of this sort is liable to take  
any action as an opportunity for attack. And if it seems good  
to dismiss anyone from a position of power, he should do  
this by stages and not take away all his authority at once.  
Furthermore, he should put a curb on himself against every  
sort of insolent act, and against two kinds above all, corporal  
punishment and molestation of the young. This is a precaution that needs to be taken especially toward those who are  
passionate about their honor. For while money-lovers take  
it hard when there is a slight to their possessions, honorlovers and decent human beings feel that way about dishonor. Hence he either ought not to engage in such acts, or  
he must make a display of inflicting punishments in a paternal manner and not in order to demean, and of having  
intimate relations with the young from erotic motives and  
not licentiously. In general, he should buy off any appearances of dishonor with greater honors. Of the people who  
make attempts at destruction upon the person of the tyrant,  
those who are most to be feared and need the most watching  
are the ones who have no intention of preserving their own  
lives when they destroy his. This is why he needs to be especially cautious about people who consider either themselves  
or those they happen to care about to have been treated with  
humiliating insolence, for those who attack out of spirited  
anger are of no mind to be sparing of themselves. It is just as  
Heracleitus says, when he declares it is hard to fight against  
spiritedness, for the price it pays is life.  
And since cities are organized out of two parts, needy  
human beings and those who are well off, in the best case  
both ought to assume they are being kept safe by the tyrant’s  
rule and one group is suffering no injustice from the other;  
but whichever of the two is stronger, private persons of that  
class should especially be made part of his rule, since, if this  
group is on the side of his interests, there will be no necessity  
for the tyrant to resort to a freeing of slaves or a confiscation  
of arms. For one of the two parts will be enough, when added to his power, to make it stronger than those who might  
attack it. To speak of such things for each case would be too  
fussy. For the aim is obvious, that he ought not to appear

1315B

to his subjects to be tyrannical, but managerial and kingly,  
not someone who looks out for number one but a trustee,  
and appear to pursue the moderate things in life rather than  
the extremes, and also appear to be favoring the prominent  
people with his company while courting popularity with the  
masses. The necessary result of these measures is that not  
only will his rule be more beautiful and enviable, by virtue  
of ruling over people who are better and not debased and  
accomplishing this without being hated and feared, but also  
his rule will be longer-lasting; furthermore, he himself will  
either have his character in beautiful shape as far as virtue is  
concerned, or be halfway decent, and not vicious but halfvicious.172
