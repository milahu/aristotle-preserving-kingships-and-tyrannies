### 1313b.1

Reeve:  
"cutting down the outstanding men  
and eliminating the high-minded ones"

Sachs:  
"by cutting down those who stand out  
and getting rid of those with proud thoughts"

Rackham:  
"the lopping off of outstanding men  
and the destruction of the proud"

Jowett:  
"that the tyrant should lop off those who are too high;  
he must put to death men of spirit"

Ellis:  
"to keep down those who are of an aspiring disposition,  
to take off those who will not submit"

Simpson:  
"cutting down the superior  
and doing away with those of high thoughts"

Lord1984, Lord2013:  
"lopping off the preeminent  
and eliminating those with high thoughts"

Sinclair1981:  
"Lop off the eminent  
and get rid of men of independent spirit"

Barker1948:  
"the 'lopping off' of outstanding men,  
and the removal of men of spirit"



### 1313b.9

Reeve:  
"It is also tyrannical to impoverish the people,  
so that they cannot afford a militia  
and are so occupied with their daily work  
that they lack the leisure for plotting."

Sachs:  
"It is also characteristic of tyrants to make their subjects poor,  
both so that they cannot maintain a militia,  
and so that they are too busy looking after daily needs  
to have free time to get into conspiracies."

Rackham:  
"And it is a device of tyranny to make the subjects poor,  
so that a guard may not be kept,  
and also that the people being busy with their daily affairs  
may not have leisure to plot against their ruler."

Jowett:  
"Also he should impoverish his subjects;  
he thus provides against the maintenance of a guard by the citizen  
and the people, having to keep hard at work, are prevented from conspiring."

Ellis:  
"It is also advantageous for a tyranny  
that all those who are under it should be oppressed with poverty,  
that they may not be able to compose a guard;  
and that, being employed in procuring their daily bread,  
they may have no leisure to conspire against their tyrants."

Simpson:  
"Tyrannical also is making the ruled poor,
so that they can provide themselves no defense,
and, being taken up with daily needs, have no leisure for plotting."

Lord1984, Lord2013:  
"It is also a feature of tyranny to make the ruled poor,  
so that they cannot sustain their own defense,  
and are so occupied with their daily needs that they lack the leisure to conspire."

Sinclair1981:  
"It is also in the interests of a tyrant to make his subjects poor,  
so that he may be able to afford the cost of his bodyguard,  
while the people are so occupied with their daily tasks that they have no time for plotting."

Barker1948:  
"Finally, a policy pursued by tyrants is that of impoverishing their subjects —
partly to prevent them from having the means for maintaining a civic guard;
partly to keep them so busy in earning a daily pittance that they have no time for plotting."



### 1313b.11

Reeve:  
"And while a kingship is preserved by its friends,  
it is the mark of a tyrant to distrust his friends,  
on the grounds that while all his subjects wish to overthrow him,  
these are particularly capable of doing so."

Sachs:  
"And whereas kingship is preserved —  
by its friends,  
it is characteristic of a tyrant to distrust his friends most of all,  
because what everyone wants,  
they have the most power to carry out."

Rackham:  
"Also whereas friends are a means of security to royalty,  
it is a mark of a tyrant to be extremely distrustful of his friends,  
on the ground that, while all have the wish,  
these chiefly have the power."

Jowett:  
"And whereas the power of a king is preserved by his friends,  
the characteristic of a tyrant is to distrust his friends,  
because he knows that all men want to overthrow him, and they above all have the power."

Ellis:  
"A king is preserved by his friends,  
but a tyrant is of all persons the man who can place no confidence in friends,  
as every one has it in his desire and these chiefly in their power to destroy him."

Simpson:  
"Further, while kingship is preserved by friends,  
it is a mark of tyranny to distrust friends most of all  
because, though everyone wants to attempt something,  
these are most able to do it."

Lord2013:  
"Kingship is preserved by friends of the king,  
but it is characteristic of the tyrant to distrust his friends,  
on the assumption that all wish to overthrow him, but these are particularly capable of it."

Sinclair1981:  
"Friends are a source of stability to a kingship, but not to a tyrant;  
it is part of his policy to mistrust them more than anyone, as having  
more than anyone the power to do what all the others merely wish."

Barker1948:  
"Kings are maintained and secured by their friends;  
tyrants, going on the principle  
'All men want my overthrow, but my friends have most power to effect it',  
distrust them above all others."



### 1314a

Reeve:  
"decent people act out of friendship, not flattery."

Sachs:  
"Decent people are friends; in other words, they do not flatter."

Rackham:  
"men of character love their ruler, or at all events do not flatter him."  
exact opposite!

Jowett, Ellis:  
"for they love the virtuous, but flatter none."

Simpson:  
"the decent can be friends, but they are no flatterers."

Lord1984, Lord2013:  
"respectable persons may be friends, but they will certainly not flatter."

Sinclair1981:  
"Respectable men give friendship, or at any rate refrain from flattery"

Barker1948:  
"a good man may be a friend, but at any rate he will not be a flatterer."
