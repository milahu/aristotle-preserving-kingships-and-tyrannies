Aristotle - Politics - Book V - Chapter 11: Preserving Kingships and Tyrannies

Chapter 11

It is clear, to put it simply, that monarchies are preserved by the opposite  
causes. ut kingships in particular are preserved by being made more  
moderate. For the fewer areas over which kings have authority, the  
longer must their office remain intact. For they themselves become less  
like masters, more equal in their characters, and less envied by those  
they rule. That is also why the kingships of the Molossians lasted a long  
time, and that of the Spartans as well. In the latter case it was because  
the office was divided into two parts from the beginning, and again because  
Theopompus, besides moderating it in other ways, instituted the  
office of the overseers.

By diminishing the power of the kingship he  
increased its duration, so that in a way he made it greater, not lesser. He  
is supposed to have given precisely this answer, indeed, when his wife  
asked him whether he was not ashamed to hand over a lesser kingship to  
his sons than the one he had inherited from his father: "Certainly not,"  
he said, "for I am handing over one that will be longer lasting."

Tyrannies are preserved in two quite opposite ways.

One of them is traditional and is the way most tyrants exercise their rule.  
Periander of Corinth is said to have instituted most of its devices,  
but many may also be seen in the Persian empire.

These include the device we mentioned some time ago as tending to preserve a tyranny  
(to the extent that it can be preserved):

\[1313b.1\]  
cutting down the outstanding men  
and eliminating the high-minded ones.  
Others are:

\[1313b.2\]  
Prohibiting messes, clubs, education, and other things of that sort.

\[1313b.3\]  
Keeping an eye on anything that typically engenders two things:  
high-mindedness and mutual trust.

\[1313b.4\]  
Prohibiting schools and other gatherings connected with learning,  
and doing everything to ensure  
that people are as ignorant of one another as possible,  
since knowledge tends to give rise to mutual trust.

\[1313b.5\]  
Requiring the residents to be always in public view  
and to pass their time at the palace gates.  
For their activities will then be hard to keep secret  
and they will become humble-minded from always acting like slaves.

\[1313b.6\]  
Imposing all the other restrictions of a similar nature  
that are found in Persian and non-Greek tyrannies  
(for they are all capable of producing the same effect).

\[1313b.7\]  
Another is trying to  
let nothing done or said by any of his subjects escape notice,  
but to retain spies,  
like the so-called women informers of Syracuse,  
or the eavesdroppers that Hiero sent to every meeting or gathering.  
For people speak less freely when they fear the presence of such spies,  
and if they do speak freely, they are less likely to go unnoticed.

\[1313b.8\]  
Another is to slander people to one another,  
setting friend against friend,  
the people against the notables,  
and the rich against themselves.

\[1313b.9\]  
It is also tyrannical to impoverish the people,  
so that they cannot afford a militia  
and are so occupied with their daily work  
that they lack the leisure for plotting.  
The pyramids of Egypt, the Cypselid monuments,  
the construction of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Pisistratids,  
and the works on Samos commissioned by Polycrates are all examples of this.  
For all these things have the same result,  
lack of leisure and poverty for the ruled.

\[1313b.10\]  
And there is taxation, as in Syracuse,  
when, during the reign of Dionysius,  
taxation ate up a person's entire estate in five years.

\[1313b.11\]  
A tyrant also engages in warmongering  
in order that his subjects will lack leisure  
and be perpetually in need of a leader.  
And while a kingship is preserved by its friends,  
it is the mark of a tyrant to distrust his friends,  
on the grounds that while all his subjects wish to overthrow him,  
these are particularly capable of doing so.  
All the practices found in the extreme kind of democracy  
are also characteristic of a tyranny:

\[1313b.12\]  
the dominance of women in the household,  
in order that they may report on the men,  
and

\[1313b.13\]  
the license of slaves for the same reason.  
For slaves and women not only do not plot against tyrants but,  
because they prosper under them,  
are inevitably well disposed toward tyrannies  
and toward democracies as well  
(for the people too aspire to be a monarch).  
That is why a flatterer is honored in both constitutions -  
in democracies, the popular leader  
(for the popular leader is a flatterer of the people),  
in tyrannies, those who are obsequious in their dealings with the tyrant,  
which is precisely a task for flattery.

\[1314a\]  
For that is also why tyranny loves vice.  
For tyrants delight in being flattered.  
But no free-minded person would flatter them.  
On the contrary, decent people act out of friendship, not flattery.

The vicious are also useful for vicious tasks -  
"nail to nail," as the saying goes.

And it is characteristic of a tyrant  
not to delight in anyone who is dignified or free-minded.  
For a tyrant thinks that he alone deserves to be like that.  
But anyone who is a rival in dignity or free-mindedness  
robs tyranny of its superiority and its status as a master of slaves,  
and so tyrants hate him as a threat to their rule.

And it is also characteristic of a tyrant  
to have foreigners rather than people from the city-state as dinner guests and companions,  
on the grounds that the former are hostile to him,  
whereas the latter oppose him in nothing.

These devices are characteristic of tyrants and help preserve their rule,  
but there is no vice they leave out.

They all fall into three categories, broadly speaking.  
For tyranny aims at three things:

first, that the ruled think small,  
for a pusillanimous person would plot against no one;

second, that they distrust one another,  
for a tyranny will not be overthrown until some people trust each other.  
This is also why tyrants attack decent people.  
They view them as harmful to their rule  
not only because they refuse to be ruled as by a master,  
but also because they command trust among both themselves and others,  
and do not inform on one another or on anyone else.

Third, that the ruled be powerless to act.  
For no one tries to do what is impossible,  
and so no one tries to overthrow a tyranny if he lacks the power.

Thus the wishes of tyrants may be reduced in fact to these three defining principles,  
since all tyrannical aims might be reduced to these three tenets:  
that the ruled not trust one another;  
that they be powerless;  
that they think small.

This, then, is one way in which the preservation of tyrannies comes about.

The other involves precautions that are pretty much the opposite of those just discussed.  
One may grasp it by considering the destruction of kingships.  
For just as one way to destroy a kingship is to make its rule more tyrannical,  
so one way to preserve a tyranny is to make it more like a kingship.

One thing only must be safeguarded, the tyrant's power,  
so he can rule not just willing subjects but unwilling ones as well.  
For if this power is lost, the tyranny is also.

But while this must remain a basic principle,  
a tyrant should perform or seem to perform everything else in a noble, kingly fashion.  
First, then,

\[1314b.1\]  
he should seem to take care of public funds.  
He should not squander them on gifts that enrage the multitude,  
taking money from people who are laboring and toiling in penury,  
and lavishing it on prostitutes, foreigners, and craftsmen.

He should also render an account of funds received and expended,  
as some tyrants in the past have done.  
For in this way, he will give the impression of managing the city-state  
like the head of a household rather than a tyrant.

He should not be afraid of running short of funds,  
since he has authority over the citystate.

At any event, it is even more beneficial for tyrants  
who are often away on foreign campaigns to do this  
than to amass a great hoard of wealth and leave it behind.  
For those who guard the city-state will be less likely to seize his things.  
A tyrant on a foreign campaign has more to fear from such guards, indeed, than from the citizens.  
For the citizens accompany him, while the guards stay behind.

Next, it should appear that taxes and public services exist for the purposes of administration,  
and to meet the needs of military emergencies.  
In a word: a tyrant should pose as a guardian and steward of the public funds,  
not of his own private estate.

\[1314b.2\]  
He should also appear not harsh but dignified, the kind of person  
who inspires awe rather than fear in those who meet him. But this is not  
easily achieved if he is contemptible. That is why even if a tyrant neglects  
the other virtues, he must cultivate military virtue  
and get himself a reputation for it.  
Furthermore,

\[1314b.3\]  
not only should he himself avoid any appearance of  
behaving arrogantly toward any teenage boys and girls among his sub

jects, but neither should any of his followers. The women of his household  
should also be similarly respectful toward other women, as the arrogant  
behavior of women has caused the downfall of many tyrannies.  
Where bodily pleasures are concerned, the tyrant should do the opposite  
of what some in fact do. For they not only begin their debaucheries  
at dawn and continue them for days on end, but they also wish to be seen  
doing so by others, in order that they may be admired as happy and  
blessed. But above all the tyrant should be moderate in such matters, or  
failing that, he should at least avoid exhibiting his indulgence to others.  
For it is not easy to attack or despise a sober or wakeful man, but it is  
easy to attack or despise a drunk or drowsy one.

\[1314b.4\]  
A tyrant must do the opposite of pretty well all the things we mentioned a while back.  
For he must lay out and beautify the city-state as  
if he were a household steward rather than a tyrant.

Again,

\[1314b.5\]  
a tyrant should always be seen to be very zealous about  
matters concerning the gods, but without appearing foolish in the  
process. For people are less afraid of suffering illegal treatment at the  
hands of such people.

\[1315a\]  
And if they regard their ruler as a god-fearing  
man who pays heed to the gods, they plot against him less, since they  
think that he has the gods on his side.

\[1315a.6\]  
A tyrant should so honor those who prove to be good in any area  
S that they do not expect that they would be more honored by citizens living under their own laws. He should bestow such honors himself, but  
punishments should be administered by other officials and by the  
courts. But it is a precaution common to every sort of monarchy not to  
make any one man important, but where necessary to elevate several, so  
that they will keep an eye on one another. If it happens to be necessary to  
make one man important, however, at all events it should not be some10 one of courageous character. For men of this sort are the most enterprising in any sphere of action. And if it is considered necessary to remove  
someone from power, his prerogatives should be taken away gradually,  
not all at once.

\[1315a.7\]  
A tyrant should refrain from all forms of arrogance, and from two  
IS in particular: corporal punishment and arrogance toward adolescents.  
This is particularly true where those who love honor are concerned. For  
while lovers of money resent contemptuous acts affecting their property, honor lovers and decent human beings resent those involving dis

honor. Hence either he should not treat people in these ways or else he 20  
should appear to punish like a father, not out of contempt; and to engage  
in sexual relations with young people out of sexual desire, and not as if it  
were a prerogative of his office. And as a general rule, he should compensate apparent dishonors with yet greater honors. Of those who make  
attempts on his life, a tyrant should most fear and take the greatest pre- 25  
cautions against those who are ready to sacrifice their own lives to destroy him. Hence he should be particularly wary of people who think  
that he has behaved arrogantly toward them or those they happen to  
cherish. For people who attack out of anger are careless of themselves.  
As Heraclitus said, "Anger is a hard enemy to combat, because it pays 30  
for what it wants with life."

\[1315a.8\]  
Since city-states consist of two parts, poor and rich, it is best if  
both believe that they owe their safety to the tyrant's rule, and that neither  
is unjustly treated by the other because of it. But whichever of them  
is the stronger should be particularly attached to his rule, so that with  
his power thus increased he will not need to free slaves or confiscate  
weapons. For the latter of the two parts added to his force will be enough  
to make them stronger than attackers.  
But it is superfluous to discuss all such measures in detail. For their  
aim is evident. A tyrant should appear to his subjects not as a tyrant but  
as a head of household and a kingly man,

\[1315b\]

not as an embezzler but as a  
steward. He should also pursue the moderate things in life, not excess,  
maintaining close relations with the notables, while playing the popular  
leader with the many. For as a result, not only will his rule necessarily be  
nobler and more enviable, but since he rules better people who have not  
been humiliated he will not end up being hated and feared. And his rule S  
will be longer lasting, and his character will either be nobly disposed to  
virtue or else half good, not vicious but half vicious.
