Chapter 11

Preservation of Monarchies

Kingships. Kingships are preserved above all by being made more measured.

1313a18

Monarchies, it is clear, are preserved, to speak simply, by what  
comes from the contrary sources but, in the case of kingships in particular,  
by being drawn toward something more measured. For the fewer the  
things over which kings have control, the longer must their entire rule last;  
they become less despotic themselves, more equal in their character, and  
less envied by those they rule over. That is also why the kingship of the  
Molossians lasted a long time and why that of the Spartans has lasted, both  
because the office was divided from the beginning into two parts and again  
because Theopompus, besides making it more measured in other ways, set  
up in addition the office of the ephors. By diminishing the power of the  
kingship, he increased it in duration so that, in a way, he made it not less  
but greater. That is also what they say he replied to his wife when she asked  
him if he was not ashamed to be handing over a lesser kingship to his sons  
than he had received from his father. "Not at all," he said, "because what I  
am handing over is more lasting."

Tyrannies. Tyrannies are preserved in two opposite ways: (i) the traditional way of  
making them more tyrannical by the use of a multitude of devices, which leave nothing  
out in point of wickedness, for securing among the subjects (a) thinking small, (6)  
mutual distrust, (c) weakness; (ii) the opposite way of making tyrannies more kingly,  
so that the tyrant (a) appears a steward and trustee of the city's wealth; (b) appears  
dignified and venerable through military virtue, measured behavior, stewardship, and  
piety; (c) distributes honors justly and carefully and refrains from, or covers up, acts of  
insolence; (d) appears a friend to both notables and populace alike. This second way  
will make the tyranny better and longer lasting and the tyrant himself a better man.

1313a34

Tyrannies are preserved in two ways that are most opposed to each  
other. One of them is the traditional one, the one in accordance with which  
most tyrants manage their rule. Periander the Corinthian is alleged to have  
established most of these devices, but it is possible also to gather many things  
of like sort from the rule of the Persians. Besides the things mentioned  
some time ago for the preservation — to the extent that that is possible — of tyranny,  
namely

\[1313b.1\]  
cutting down the superior and doing away with those of high thoughts,"

\[1313b.2\]  
there are also:  
not allowing common messes nor clubs nor education nor anything else of the sort

\[1313b.3\]  
but guarding against everything from which are wont to arise two things,  
high thoughts and trust;

\[1313b.4\]  
not permitting schools\*\* nor other leisurely gatherings to take place and doing everything  
that will make everyone as much as possible ignorant of each another, for  
knowledge makes for more mutual trust among people;

\[1313b.5\]  
in addition, keeping the residents always in view and having them wait at the tyrant's doors,  
for what they are doing will in this way least escape notice  
and by always serving as slaves they will get used to thinking small.

\[1313b.6\]  
Other things of like sort found among Persians and barbarians are tyrannical,  
for they all have the same effect.

\[1313b.7\]  
There is also trying to let nothing that any of the subjects happens  
to say or do go unnoticed, but to have spies like the so-called women inducers  
among the Syracusans and the eavesdroppers Hiero °° sent out wherever there  
was some meeting or gathering, for people speak less freely when  
they fear such spies and if they do speak freely, they escape notice less.

\[1313b.8\]  
There is also slandering people to each other and setting friends against friends,  
the populace against the notables, the wealthy against themselves.

\[1313b.9\]  
Tyrannical also is making the ruled poor, so that they can provide themselves no defense  
and, being taken up with daily needs, have no leisure for plotting.  
As examples of this are the pyramids in Egypt, the votive monuments of the  
Cypselids, the building of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Peisistratids,  
and the works of Polycrates on the temples at Samos. For all these things  
have the same effect: lack of leisure and poverty for the subjects.

\[1313b.10\]  
There is also paying of taxes, as in Syracuse where in the time of Dionysius their total  
substance was paid over in five years.

\[1313b.11\]  
A tyrant is also a maker of war, so that  
the ruled may have no leisure and be continually in need of a leader.  
Further, while kingship is preserved by friends, it is a mark of tyranny to distrust  
friends most of all because, though everyone wants to attempt something,  
these are most able to do it.

Everything that happens in ultimate democracy is also typical of tyranny:

\[1313b.12\]  
dominance of women about the house so that they can inform on  
their husbands,

\[1313b.13\]  
and, for the same reason, the license of slaves.  
For slaves and women do not plot against tyrants and,  
because they are having a good time,  
are of necessity kindly disposed to tyrannies and democracies.  
For the populace too wants to be a monarch.

That is also why both hold the flatterer in honor —  
the populace the demagogue (for the demagogue is the flatterer of the populace)  
and the tyrant fawning hangers-on  
(for fawning is the work of flattery).

\[1314a\]  
For this reason too tyranny is dear to the wicked,  
for tyrants are glad to be flattered,  
but no one possessed of freedom of thought would do this.  
On the contrary, the decent can be friends, but they are no flatterers.

The wicked are also useful for wicked things; "nail for nail," as the  
proverb says. It is also a mark of tyranny not to take delight in anyone who  
is dignified or free, for the tyrant supposes he alone deserves to be like that.  
But one who is a rival in dignity and asserts his freedom deprives tyranny  
of its superiority and of its character of despotism, and so tyrants hate such  
people as being destroyers of their rule. It is, further, a mark of tyranny to  
use foreigners rather than people of the city for companions at dinner and  
for spending time with, because the latter are his enemies while the former  
are not going to assert rival claims.

1314a12

These and the like things are marks of tyranny and preserve its  
rule, and in respect of depravity they leave nothing out. All of them, more or  
less, can be embraced under three heads. For tyranny aims at three things:  
first, the ruled thinking small, for someone small-souled would piot against  
no one; second, the ruled not trusting each other, for a tyranny cannot be  
overthrown until some start trusting each other (which is why tyrants in  
fact wage war on the decent sort as being harmful to their rule, not only on  
the ground that the decent do not think they deserve to be ruled despotically,  
but also on they ground that they are faithful both to themselves and  
to others and accuse neither themselves nor others); third, powerlessness to  
do anything, for no one will put his hand to what is impossible and so not to  
overthrowing a tyranny either if he has no power. The heads, then, to which  
all the wishes of tyrants can be reduced turn out to be these three, for one  
may reduce all marks of tyranny to these suppositions: some of them are for  
making subjects not trust each other; others for making them powerless;  
others for making them think small.

1314a29

One way, then, by which to preserve tyrannies is like this. A second devotes  
its care to virtually the opposite of what has just been said. One  
can get an understanding of it from the way kingship is destroyed. For as  
one way of destroying kingship is to make rule more tyrannical, so a way of  
saving tyranny is to make it more kingly, keeping watch over one thing only,  
the tyrant's power, so he can rule his subjects not only when they are willing  
but also when they are unwilling. For ifhe lets go of this, he lets go also of his  
tyranny. Instead this must remain as a presupposition, and he must either do  
or seem to do everything else acting out in noble manner the part of king.

1314a40

First, then, he must seem to be taking care of the common funds  
not only by not spending money on such gifts as enrage the multitude (when  
he takes from their grinding work and toil and gives lavishly to mistresses,  
foreigners, and artisans), but also by rendering account of the revenues he  
received and the expenses he paid (as some tyrants have in fact done in the  
past). For in this way he would seem a householder in his management of  
things and not a tyrant. He has no need to fear, having control of the city  
as he does, that he will ever run out of money; but for those tyrants, at any  
rate, who go abroad from their own territory, this practice is of more advantage  
than collecting a great hoard and leaving it behind. For then those  
guarding it would make fewer attempts against the tyrant's position, and a  
tyrant is more afraid when traveling abroad of those left to do the guarding  
than of citizens, since the citizens go with him but the former stay behind.  
Next, he should conspicuously impose taxes and public service for the purpose  
of household management and for occasions of war, if there should  
ever be need. And generally he should present himself as a guardian and  
steward of common and not of private funds.

1314b18

Also, he must appear not harsh but dignified, and such, further, as  
to inspire not fear but reverence in those who come upon him.  
It is, however, not easy for one who is readily despised to achieve this, so even if he  
gives no care to other virtues, he should to warlike\*' virtue and create about  
himself'a reputation for being such. Further, he should not only be conspicuous  
himself in not treating any of his subjects insolently, whether youth or  
maiden, but so should everyone else among his entourage. The womenfolk  
too should behave similarly toward other women because many tyrannies  
have also been destroyed by the insolent behavior of women. As regards  
bodily indulgences, he should do the opposite of what some tyrants do now.  
For not only do they engage in this indulgence as soon as it is dawn and continue  
for many days, but also, in order to be admired as happy and blessed,  
they wish their doing so to be conspicuous in the sight of others. Yet in such  
things they ought to be most measured, or if not, they should at least avoid  
being seen by others. For it is not someone sober who is easily attacked and  
despised but the drunkard, not he who is alert but he who dozes. And the  
opposite of pretty much everything said before must be done. For he must  
furnish and adorn the city as if he were a steward and not a tyrant. Further,  
with respect to what concerns the gods, he must be conspicuous in being  
always exceptionally serious. For if people think the ruler stands in awe of  
the divine and takes thought for the gods, they have less fear that they will  
suffer something illegal at such hands as his. They also plot less against him  
believing he has the gods as well on his side. But the way he displays himself  
as such must be without any silliness.

1315a4

As regards those who are good in any respect, he must give them  
such honor that they do not think they would receive more honor at the  
hands of citizens living under their own laws. Also, he should distribute  
such honors himself, but punishments he should have dispensed by others,  
whether officials or law courts. But it is a defense common to any monarchy  
not to make anyone great, or if need be to make several so (for they  
will watch each other). If, however, there is need to make some one person  
great, let him at any rate not be bold in character. For a character of this  
sort is most impetuous whatever the action. And if it should seem good to  
remove someone from power, it must be done gradually, and all his ability  
must not be taken away at once.

1315a14

Further, he should refrain from every sort of insolence, and from  
two above all: punishment directed against a person's body and against his  
youth. Especially must this care be taken in the case of those who love  
honor. For while those who love money take it ill when they are slighted  
in regard to their money, those who love honor and are the decent among  
human beings take it ill when they are slighted in regard to their honor.  
Hence, either he should not engage in such acts or he should inflict punishments  
in a manifestly fatherly spirit, not out of slight, and should engage  
in sexual relations with youth for reasons of love, not because he has the  
power to. And as a general rule he should compensate apparent losses of  
honor with grants of greater honors. Of those who attempt assassination,  
most to be feared and most in need of watching are those who are not planning  
to save their life after they have destroyed his. Hence, it is necessary to  
take especial care with respect to those who think that either they or their  
loved ones have been treated insolently.\*\* For they who are driven to their  
attempts by spiritedness are not sparing of themselves. As even Heracleitus  
said: "to fight with spiritedness is hard, for it buys with its soul." °°

1315a31

Since there are two parts that make up cities, needy human beings  
and prosperous ones, what would be best is if both of them supposed that  
it was because of the tyrant's rule that they were being preserved and that  
neither of them was being wronged by the other. But whichever side is the  
stronger, these above all the tyrant should make privy to his rule since, with  
these supporting his interests, there will be no necessity for him to engage  
in freeing slaves or confiscating arms. For the addition of one or the other  
part to his power will be enough to make them stronger than attackers.

1315a40

But it is superfluous to speak about such things in detail. The goal  
is manifest, that the tyrant must seem to his subjects not tyrannical but a  
household manager and a king, not an embezzler but a trustee. He must  
also pursue measure in his way of life, not excess, and must keep company  
with the notables while being a demagogue to the many. For as a result,  
not only will his rule be more noble and more enviable because exercised  
over better people instead of over those who have been rendered abject, and  
not only will he not end up being hated and feared, but his rule will also  
be longer lasting and, in addition, he himself will, in his character, either be  
nobly disposed for virtue or half serviceable for the purpose, and not wicked  
but half wicked.
