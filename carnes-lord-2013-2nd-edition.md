Chapter 11

It is clear that they are preserved, on the other hand, by opposite things  
simply speaking, and in the case of kingships in particular, by drawing  
them toward greater moderateness.

For the fewer the things over which  
kings have authority, the greater the period of time their rule as a whole  
will necessarily last: they themselves are less like masters and more equal  
in their characters, and are less envied by those they rule.

It is on this  
account that the kingship of the Molossians has lasted for a long time, and  
also that of the Spartans, both because the office was divided from the  
beginning into two parts and because Theopompus moderated it, among  
other things by establishing in addition the office of the overseers.

By taking away from its power, he increased the duration of the kingship, and  
so in a certain manner made it not less but greater.

This is just what he is supposed to have answered his wife  
when she asked him whether he was not ashamed  
to hand over to his sons a kingship that was lesser than the  
one he had received from his father, and he said: "Not at all—I am  
handing over one that will be longer lasting."



Tyrannies are preserved in two modes that are quite opposite to one another.

One is the mode that has been handed down, according to which  
most tyrants administer their rule.

Most of these \[tyrannical methods\] are  
said to have been established by Periander of Corinth;  
many such things may also be seen in the rule of the Persians.

These include both what was spoken of some time ago  
as relating to the preservation (so far as this is possible) of tyrannies —

\[1313b.1\]  
lopping off the preeminent and eliminating those with high thoughts —

\[1313b.2\]  
and also not permitting common messes, clubs, education, or anything else of this sort,

\[1313b.3\]  
but guarding against anything that customarily gives rise to two things,  
high thoughts and trust.

\[1313b.4\]  
Leisured discussions are not allowed, or other meetings connected with leisure,
but everything is done to make all as ignorant of one another as possible,  
since knowledge tends to create trust of one another.

\[1313b.5\]  
Also, residents of the city are made to be always in evidence  
and pass their time about the doors \[of the tyrant’s palace\];  
in this way their activities would escape notice least of all,  
and they would become habituated to having small thoughts through always acting like slaves.

\[1313b.6\]  
And there are other such features of tyranny,  
in Persia and among the barbarians, which have the same power.

\[1313b.7\]  
Also, to attempt to let nothing that is done or said by any of those he rules escape his notice,  
but to have spies,  
like the women called "inducers" at Syracuse, and the "eavesdroppers" Hiero sent  
out whenever there was some meeting or gathering (for men speak less  
freely when they fear such persons, and if they do speak freely they are  
less likely to escape notice).

\[1313b.8\]  
Also a feature of tyranny is to slander  
them to one another, and set friends at odds with friends, the people with  
the notables, and the wealthy with themselves.

\[1313b.9\]  
It is also a feature of tyranny to make the ruled poor,  
so that they cannot sustain their own defense,  
and are so occupied with their daily needs that they lack the leisure to conspire.  
Examples of this are the pyramids in Egypt,  
the monuments of the Cypselids,  
the construction of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Pisistratids,  
and the work done by Polycrates on the temples at Samos.  
All of these things have the same effect —  
lack of leisure and poverty on the part of the ruled.

\[1313b.10\]  
There is also the matter of taxes,  
as in Syracuse, where in the time of Dionysius it happened  
that they were taxed for their entire property over a period of five years.

\[1313b.11\]  
The tyrant is also a warmonger,  
so that they will always be kept lacking in leisure  
and in need of a leader.

Kingship is preserved by friends of the king, but it is  
characteristic of the tyrant to distrust his friends, on the assumption that  
all wish to overthrow him, but these are particularly capable of it.

Everything that happens in connection with democracy of the  
extreme sort is characteristic of tyranny —

\[1313b.12\]  
dominance of women in the household,  
so that they may report on their husbands,  

\[1313b.13\]  
and laxness toward slaves for the same reasons.

Slaves and women do not conspire against  
tyrants, and as they prosper under such circumstances they necessarily  
have a benevolent view both of tyrannies and of democracies (for, indeed,  
the people wish to be a monarch).

Hence also the flatterer is held in honor by both —  
the popular leader by peoples,  
as the popular leader is a flatterer of the people, and by tyrants,  
persons approaching them in obsequious fashion,  
which is the work of flattery.

\[1314a\]  
On this account tyranny is friendly to the base,  
for they delight in being flattered,  
and no one would do this who had free thoughts:  
respectable persons may be friends, but they will certainly not flatter.

And the base are useful for base things:  
"nail \[is driven out\] by nail," as the proverb has it.

It is also a feature of tyranny not to delight in anyone who is dignified or free;  
for the tyrant alone claims to merit being such, and one who asserts a rival dignity  
and a spirit of freedom takes away the preeminence and the element of  
mastery of tyranny;  
hence these are hated as persons undermining the  
tyrant’s rule.

It is also characteristic of the tyrant to have foreigners  
rather than persons from the city as companions for dining and  
entertainment, the assumption being that the latter are enemies, while the  
former do not act as rivals.  
Such things are, then, characteristic of tyrants and help preserve their  
rule—though in no respect do they fall short in depravity.

All of these  
things are encompassed, so to speak, under three heads.

For tyranny  
aims at three things: one, that the ruled have only modest thoughts (for a  
small-souled person will not conspire against anyone);  
second, that they  
distrust one another (for a tyranny will not be overthrown before some  
persons are able to trust each other—hence they make war on the  
respectable as being harmful to their rule not merely because they claim  
not to merit being ruled in the fashion of a master, but also because they  
are trustworthy, both among themselves and with respect to others, and  
will not denounce one another or others);

and third, an incapacity for activity,  
for no one will undertake something on behalf of those who are  
incapable, so that not even a tyranny will be overthrown where the  
capacity is lacking.

The defining principles to which the wishes of tyrants  
may be reduced are, then, these three.

For one might reduce all things  
characteristic of tyranny to these presuppositions—that they not trust one  
another, that they not be capable, that they have modest thoughts.

The one mode of preservation for tyrannies, then, is of this sort;  
the other involves a sort of superintendence that is practically the opposite of  
what has been spoken of.

One may grasp this in connection with the  
destruction of kingships.

For just as one mode of destruction for kingship  
is to make the rule more tyrannical, so it is a source of preservation for  
tyranny to make it more kingly, provided one thing only is safeguarded—  
his power,  
so that he may rule not only willing persons, but also those  
who are unwilling;  
for if this is thrown away, so is the tyranny.

This must remain as a presupposition, then, but in whatever else he does or is  
held to do he should give a fine performance of the part of the kingly ruler.  
In the first

\[1314b\]

place, he should be held to take thought for the  
common funds, not only by not making expenditures on gifts that enrage  
the multitude (when they take from persons working and exerting  
themselves in penury, and give lavishly to prostitutes, foreigners, and  
artisans), but also by rendering an account of what has been taken in and  
what expended, as some tyrants have in fact done in the past.

One  
administering matters in this way might be held a manager \[of the city\]  
rather than a tyrant.

There is no need to be afraid of running short of  
funds, since he has authority in the city;  
and, in any event, for tyrants who  
are campaigning away from their own territory this is even more  
advantageous than leaving behind a great hoard, as in that case those  
safeguarding the city would be less likely to attack his position (such  
persons are more fearsome to tyrants when they are away from home than  
the citizens, for the latter are away with him, but the former remain  
behind).

Next, he should make a show of collecting taxes and public  
services for the sake of management of the city, particularly if something  
should be needed for use in times of war, and he should generally present  
himself as guardian and treasurer of common rather than private funds.  
He should appear not harsh but dignified, and further, of such a sort that  
those encountering him feel awe rather than fear.

This is not easy to  
achieve, however, for one who is readily held in contempt.

Hence, though  
he may concern himself with none of the other virtues, he must concern  
himself with military  
115 virtue, and create a reputation of this sort for  
himself.

Further, not only should he himself avoid any appearance of  
arrogant behavior toward any of those he rules, including youths and girls,  
but so also should those around him.

Their women, too, should stand  
in a similar relation to other women, for many tyrannies have perished on  
account of the arrogant behavior of women.

In connection with bodily  
gratifications, they should do the opposite of what certain tyrants now do:  
not only do they engage in this beginning at dawn and continuing for many  
days, but they wish to be seen doing so by others, so that they will be  
admired as persons who are happy and blessed.

On the contrary, he  
ought to be moderate in such matters, or if not, at least he should avoid  
appearing so to others.

It is the drunkards, not the sober, the drowsy, not  
the wakeful, who are readily attacked and held in contempt.  
Indeed, what must be done is the opposite in nearly every case of the  
things mentioned previously.

He must furnish and adorn the city as if he  
were a steward rather than a tyrant.

Further, he must always show  
himself to be seriously attentive to the things pertaining to the gods.

For men are less afraid of being treated in some respect contrary to the law by  
such persons,

\[1315a\]

if they consider the ruler a god-fearing sort who  
takes thought for the gods, and they are less ready to conspire against him  
as one who has the gods too as allies.

In showing himself of this sort,  
however, he must avoid silliness.

He should also honor those who  
have proven themselves good in some respect, and in such a way that they  
consider they would not have been honored more by citizens living under  
their own laws.

He should distribute such honors himself;  
but punishments  
should be administered through others—through officials and courts.

A precaution common to every sort of monarchy is to make no  
single person great but where necessary to elevate several persons, as they  
will watch one another.

Or if it is necessary after all to make one person  
great, it should at least not be someone who is of a bold character;  
such a  
character is most ready for the attack in connection with every sort of  
action.

And if it is held necessary to remove someone from power, this  
should be done gradually—his functions should not all be taken away at  
once.

Further, he should refrain from every sort of arrogance, and  
from two above all the rest: that involving bodily abuse, and that involving  
\[taking sexual advantage of\] youth.

This precaution is to be taken  
particularly in connection with ambitious persons.

A slight affecting their  
material goods bears heavily on the greedy;  
a slight involving dishonor  
bears heavily on the ambitious and the respectable among human beings.

Hence he must either not engage in such things, or else be seen to  
administer punishments in a paternal spirit rather than in order to slight, to  
engage in relations with the young for erotic reasons and not because of \[a  
desire to flaunt\] the license \[he enjoys\], and generally to compensate for  
any acts that are held to involve dishonor with greater honors.

Of those who make attempts at assassination, the ones who are  
most to be feared and require the most precautions are those who  
deliberately choose not to try to save their lives once they have carried out  
the assassination.

Hence he must beware particularly of those who  
consider him to have behaved arrogantly either toward themselves or  
toward those they cherish;  
for those who undertake such a deed out of  
spiritedness are not sparing of themselves.

As Heraclitus said, "it is hard  
to fight with spiritedness," as it "pays the price of soul."

Since cities are constituted out of two parts, human beings who are  
poor and others who are well off, both should conceive that they are being  
preserved and that neither is being treated unjustly by the other on account  
of the tyrant’s rule.

But whichever is stronger, these he should particularly  
attach to his rule, so that, his position being enhanced in this way, there  
will be no necessity for the tyrant to effect a freeing of slaves or a  
sequestration of heavy arms.

For the addition of one of these parts to his  
power is enough to make them superior to any attackers.

To speak of such matters in detail would be superfluous.

\[1315b\]

The aim is evident:  
he should appear to the ruled not as a tyrannical sort but  
as a manager and a kingly sort, not as an appropriator of the things of  
others but as a steward.

He should pursue moderateness in life, not the  
extremes;  
further, he should seek the company of the notables, but seek  
popularity with the many.

As a result of these things, not only will his  
rule necessarily be nobler and more enviable by the fact that he rules over  
persons who are better and have not been humbled and does so without  
being hated and feared, but his rule will also be longer lasting;  
further, in  
terms of character he will either be in a state that is fine in relation to  
virtue or he will be half-decent—not vicious but half-vicious.
