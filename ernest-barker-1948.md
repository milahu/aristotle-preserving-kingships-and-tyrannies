Chapter 11

The methods of ensuring the stability of monarchies.  
Kingships are best preserved by a policy of moderation.  
There are two ways of preserving tyrannies.

One way is the traditional tyrant's policy of repression,  
which has its analogy with thepolicy ofextreme democracy:  
its three main objects are to break the spirit ofsubjects, to sow distrust  
among them, and to make them incapable of action.

The other way is  
a policy of assimilaiing tyranny to kingship, by a good administration  
and the exercise of personal restraint;  
a wise tyrant will adorn his  
city, pay heed to public worship, honour the good, keep his own passions in check,  
and enlist in his favour as large a measure of social  
support as he possibly can.

In this way he may prolong his days, and  
attain a state of 'half-goodness'.

§ 1.

Taking a general view of monarchical forms of government,  
we may say that they are all preserved by methods the converse  
of those which are apt to cause their destruction.

Looking at them  
in detail, and taking kingship first, we may say that a king will  
preserve his throne by a policy of moderation.

The less the area  
of his prerogative, the longer will the authority of a king last  
unimpaired: he will himself be less of a master and behave more  
like an equal, and his subjects, on their side, will envy him less.

§ 2.

This is the reason for the long survival of kingship among the Molossians;  
and the survival of the Spartan kingship may also be  
attributed partly to the original division of power between the two  
kings, and partly to the general policy of moderation afterwards  
followed by Theopompus, above all in his institution of the office of Ephor.

He may be said to have strengthened Spartan kingship,  
in the long run, by depriving it of some of its original power;  
and there is a sense in which he increased rather than diminished its importance.

§ 3.

This is the point of the answer which he is  
said to have given to his wife, when she asked him if he were not  
ashamed to be leaving his sons less power than he had inherited  
from his father.

'Certainly not', he replied;  
'I am leaving them a power that will last much longer.'

§ 4.

Tyrannies can be preserved in two ways, which are utterly opposed to one another.

One of them is the traditional way;  
and it is also the method of government still followed by the majority of tyrants.

Many of its characteristics are supposed to have been  
originally instituted by Periander of Corinth;  
but many of its features may also be derived from the Persian system of government.

§ 5.

This method includes some measures previously  
mentioned, in the course of our argument, as tending to the  
preservation of tyranny (so far as it can be preserved):

\[1313b.1\]  
it includes, for instance,  
the 'lopping off' of outstanding men,  
and the removal of men of spirit.

But it also includes a number of other and additional measures.

\[1313b.2\]  
One of them is the forbidding of common meals,  
clubs, education, and anything of a like character —  

\[1313b.3\]  
or, in otherwords, a defensive attitude against everything likely to produce  
the two qualities of mutual confidence and a high spirit.

\[1313b.4\]  
A second measure is to prohibit societies for cultural purposes,  
and any gathering of a similar character:  
in a word, the adoption of every means for making every subject  
as much of a stranger as is possible to every other.

(Mutual acquaintance always tends to create mutual confidence.)

§ 6.

\[1313b.5\]  
A third line of policy is to require every resident in the city to be constantly appearing in public,  
and always hanging about the palace gates.

(This is meant to give the ruler a peep-hole into the actions of his subjects, and to inure them to  
humility by a habit of daily slavery.)

\[1313b.6\]  
This line of policy also  
includes other measures of a similar character, common in Persia  
and among the barbarians, which have all the same general effect  
of fostering tyranny.

§ 7.

\[1313b.7\]  
A fourth line of policy is that of endeavouring  
to get regular information about every man's sayings and doings.

This entails a secret police, like the female spies employed  
at Syracuse, or the eavesdroppers sent by the tyrant Hiero to all  
social gatherings and public meetings.

(Men are not so likely to speak their minds if they go in fear of a secret police;  
and if they do speak out, they are less likely to go undetected.)

§ 8.

\[1313b.8\]  
Still another line of policy is to sow mutual distrust and to foster  
discord between friend and friend;  
between people and notables;  
between one section of the rich and another.

\[1313b.9\]  
Finally, a policy pursued by tyrants is that of impoverishing their subjects —  
partly to prevent them from having the means for maintaining a civic guard;  
partly to keep them so busy in earning a daily pittance that they have no time for plotting.

§ 9.

One example of this policy is the building of the Egyptian pyramids;  
another is the lavish offerings to temples made by the family of Cypselus;  
a third is the erection of the temple to Olympian Zeus by the family of Peisistratus;  
a fourth is the additions made by Polycrates to the Samian monuments.  
(All these actions have the same object: to increase  
the poverty of the tyrant's subjects and to curtail their leisure.)

§ 10.

\[1313b.10\]  
The imposition of taxes produces a similar result.  
We may cite the example of Syracuse, where in a period offive years, during  
the tyranny of Dionysius the Elder, people were made to pay the  
whole of their property to the state.

\[1313b.11\]  
The same vein of policy also makes tyrants war-mongers,  
with the object of keeping their subjects constantly occupied and continually in need of a leader.

\[It is the sowing of distrust which is the special characteristic of tyrants.\]

Kings are maintained and secured by their friends;  
tyrants, going on the principle  
'All men want my overthrow, but my friends have most power to effect it',  
distrust them above all others.

§ 11.

The methods applied in extreme democracies are thus  
all to be found in tyrannies.

\[1313b.12\]  
They both encourage feminine influence in the family,  
in the hope that wives will tell tales of their husbands;

\[1313b.13\]  
and for a similar reason they are both indulgent to slaves.

Slaves and women are not likely to plot against tyrants:  
indeed, as they prosper under them, they are bound to favour their  
rule—as they will also favour democracies, where the people likes  
to play the sovereign as much as any tyrant.

§ 12.

This is the reason why courtiers attain a position ofhonour  
under both these forms of government.

Democracies are fond of demagogues, who may be  
called 'the courtiers of democracy', and tyrants like obsequious  
associates which it is the business of courtiers to be.

\[1314a\]  
Tyranny is thus a system which chooses bad men for its friends.  
Tyrants love to be flattered,  
and nobody with the soul of a freeman can ever stoop to that  
a good man may be a friend, but at any rate he will not be a flatterer.

§ 13.

\[Bad men are not only ready to flatter\]: they are also good tools for bad objects;  
'nail knocks out nail', as the proverb says.

It is a habit of tyrants never to like a  
man with a spirit of dignity and independence.

The tyrant claims  
a monopoly of such qualities for himself;  
he feels that anybody  
who asserts a rival dignity, or acts with independence, is trenching  
on his prerogative and the majesty of his sovereign power;  
and he hates him accordingly as a subverter of his own authority.

§ 14.

It is also a habit of tyrants to prefer the company of aliens  
to that of citizens at table and in society;  
citizens, they feel, are  
enemies, but aliens will offer no opposition.  
Such are the arts of the tyrant, and such are the means he uses  
in order to maintain his authority;  
but \[however astute they may  
be\] they plumb the depth of wrongdoing.

We may regard them  
as all summed up under three main headings, which correspond  
to the three main ends pursued by tyrants.

§ 15.

Their first end  
and aim is to break the spirit of their subjects.

They know that a  
poor-spirited man will never plot against anybody.

Their second  
aim is to breed mutual distrust.

Tyranny is never overthrown  
until men can begin to trust one another;  
and this is the reason  
why tyrants are always at outs with the good.

They feel that good  
men are doubly dangerous to their authority—dangerous, first, in  
thinking it shame to be governed as if they were slaves;  
dangerous,  
again, in their spirit of mutual and general loyalty, and in their  
refusal to betray one another or anybody else.

§ 16.

The third  
and last aim of tyrants is to make their subjects incapable of  
action.

Nobody attempts the impossible.

Nobody, therefore,  
will attempt the overthrow of a tyranny, when all are incapable of  
action.  
We have here three principles to which the ordinary policies  
of tyrants may be reduced-three ideas to which their measures  
may all be referred: (1) to breed mutual distrust among their  
subjects, (2) to make them incapable of action, and (3) to break  
their spirit.

§ 17.

Here, too, we have one of the two main methods  
for the preservation oftyrannies.

But there is also a second method,  
where the line of action followed is almost the very reverse.1  
§18.

We shall be able to understand the nature of this method if  
we go back, for a moment, to the causes which destroy kingships.  
We saw that one way of their destruction was the turning of kingship into the nature of a tyranny.

This suggests that a way of  
preserving tyrannies may be the turning of tyranny into the nature  
of a kingship—subject to the one safeguard that the reformed  
tyrant still retains power, and is still in a position to govern his  
subjects with or without their consent.

To surrender even power  
is to surrender tyranny itself.

§ 19.

Power must thus be retained,  
as an essential condition of tyranny;  
but otherwise the tyrant  
should act, or at any rate appear to act, in the role of a good player  
of the part of King.

He must show himself,1 in the first place,  
concerned for the public funds.

1314 b Not only must he refrain  
from expenditure in lavishing gifts which cause public discontent  
(and that will always arise when money is painfully wrung from a  
toiling and moiling people, and then lavishly squandered on harlots, aliens, and luxury trades);  
he must also render accounts of his  
income and expenditure—a policy which a number of tyrants have  
actually practised.

This is a method of government which will  
make him appear to be more of a steward than a tyrant.

§ 20.

There  
is no need to fear that it will involve him in a deficit, so long as he  
keeps control of affairs;  
and if he is compelled to be absent from  
home he may even find that it is more to his advantage to have a  
deficit than it would be to leave a hoard behind him.

The regents  
whom he appoints will be less likely, in that case, to make a bid  
for power;  
and a tyrant campaigning abroad has more reason to  
fear his regents than he has to fear the citizen body itself.

The  
regents remain behind: the citizens go abroad with their ruler.  
§21.

Next, and in the second place, he should levy taxes, and  
require other contributions, in such a way that they can be seen  
to be intended for the proper management of public services, or  
to be meant for use, in case of need, on military emergencies;  
and  
generally, he should act in the role of a guardian, or steward, who  
is handling public revenues rather than private income.  
\[In his personal behaviour\] a tyrant should appear grave, without being harsh;  
and his carriage should be such that men who come  
into his presence will do so with awe, and not in fear.

§ 22.

This  
is an aim which cannot easily be achieved if he fails to inspire  
respect.

He should therefore cultivate military qualities,2 even if  
he fails to cultivate others, and should give the impression of  
military efficiency.

He should also avoid all sexual offences: he  
should be personally free from any suspicion of violating the  
chastity of any of his subjects, boy or girl, and all his associates  
should be equally free from suspicion.

§ 23.

The women of his  
family should observe the same rule in dealing with other women:  
the insolence of women has often been the ruin of tyrannies.

In the matter of personal indulgence \[in the pleasures of the table\]  
the tyrant should be the opposite of some of the tyrants of our  
days, who—not content with starting at dawn and going on for  
days on end—actually want to parade their excesses, in the idea  
that men will admire their bliss and felicity.

§ 24.

Ideally, a  
tyrant should be moderate in his pleasures: if he cannot attain that  
ideal, he should at any rate appear in the eyes of the world as a  
man who eschews pleasure.

It is the drunkards, and not the sober  
—the drowsy, and not the vigilant—who are easily attacked and  
readily despised.  
Indeed, a tyrant should be the opposite of nearly everything  
which we have previously described as characteristic of tyrants.  
He should plan and adorn his city as if he were not a tyrant, but  
a trustee for its benefit.

§ 25.

He should always show a particular  
zeal in the cult of the gods.

Men are less afraid of being treated  
unjustly by a ruler, when they think that he is god-fearing 1315 a  
and pays some regard to the gods;  
and they are less ready to conspire against him, if they feel that the gods themselves are his  
friends.

At the same time, the tyrant should show his zeal without  
falling into folly.

§ 26.

He should also honour good men, in any  
walk of life;  
and he should do so in such a way as to make them  
think that they could not possibly have been honoured more by  
their own fellow-citizens, if their fellow-citizens had been free to  
distribute honours themselves.

He should distribute such honours  
personally;  
but he should leave all punishments to be inflicted by  
the magistrates or the law courts.

§ 27.

It is a precaution common to all forms of monarchical government \[and not peculiar to  
tyranny\] that no single man should be promoted to any great  
position, and if such promotion has to be made, it should be shared  
by a number of persons, who will then keep a watch upon one  
another.

But if, after all, a single man must needs be promoted  
to some great position, he should never be a man of bold spirit:  
tempers of that sort are the quickest to strike in all fields of action.  
If, on the other hand, a decision is taken to remove a man from a  
position of power, the removal should be gradual, and he should  
not be deprived of all his authority at a single blow.

§ 28.

A tyrant  
should abstain from every form of outrage, and from two forms  
above all others—the infliction of physical indignities, and violation  
of the chastity of the young.

He should show a particular caution  
of behaviour when he is dealing with men of sensitive honour.  
Arrogance in matters of money is resented by men who care about  
money;  
but it is arrogance in matters affecting honour which is  
resented by men of honour and virtue.

§ 29.

A tyrant should  
therefore abstain from such acts;  
or, at the very least, he should  
make it clear that when he inflicts any punishment, he is doing  
so not from arrogance but in a spirit of paternal discipline, and  
when he indulges himself with the young, he is doing so not in the  
licence of power but because he is genuinely in love.

In all such  
cases, too, he should atone for the dishonours which he appears  
to inflict by the gift of still greater honours.

§ 30.

Attempts at assassination are most dangerous, and need  
most watching, when they are made by men who are not concerned  
about escaping with their lives after the deed is done.

§ 31.

For this reason special precautions ought to be taken against any persons who feel that either they themselves, or others for whom they  
care, are being subjected to outrage.

Men who are acting in hot  
blood take little heed to themselves: witness the saying of Heraclitus, 'It is hard to fight against heat of the spirit, for it is willing  
to pay the price of life

§ 32.

\[In matters of social policy\] a tyrant should always remember that a state is composed of two sections—the poor and the rich.  
If it is possible, both of these sections should be induced to think  
that it is the tyrant's power which secures them in their position,  
and prevents either from suffering injury at the hands of the other.  
If, however, one of the sections is stronger than the other, the  
tyrant should attach that section particularly to his side.

There will be no need, if he has its support, to resort to such measures  
as the emancipation of slaves or the disarming of citizens.

The addition of either section to the power which he already possesses  
will make him strong enough to defeat any attempt against his  
position.

§ 33.

It is unnecessary to treat such matters as these in detail.  
The general aim is sufficiently evident.

A tyrant should appear to  
his subjects not as a despot, 1315 b but as a steward and king of  
his people.

He should show himself a trustee for the public  
interest, not a man intent on his own;  
he should make moderation,  
and not excess, the aim and end of his life;  
he should seek the  
society of the notables, and yet court the favour of the masses.

§ 34.

The benefit which he is bound to gain by such methods will  
be twofold.

In the first place, his rule will be a nobler and a more  
enviable rule: his subjects will be men of a better stamp, free from  
humiliation, and he himself will cease to be an object of hatred  
and fear.

In the second place, his rule will also be more lasting;  
and he will himself attain a habit of character,  
if not wholly disposed to goodness,  
at any rate half-good—half-good and yet halfbad,  
but at any rate not wholly bad.
