Aristotle - Politics - Book V - Chapter 11: Preserving Kingships and Tyrannies

Tyrannies on the other hand are preserved in two Preserva-extremely opposite ways. One of these is the tra- f^nnLj• ditional way and the one in which most tyrants («) repres-administer their office. Most of these ordinary safe- prwautionsguards of tyranny are said to have been instituted  
by Periander b of Corinth, and also many such devices  
may be borrowed from the Persian empire. These  
are both the measures mentioned some time back i3i3aieff.to secure the safety of a tyranny as far as possible

\[1313b.1\]  
the lopping off of outstanding men and the destruction  
of the proud,

\[1313b.2\]  
— and also the prohibition of common  
meals and club-fellowship and education and all other  
things of this nature,

\[1313b.3\]  
in fact the close watch upon  
all things that usually engender the two emotions  
of pride and confidence,

\[1313b.4\]  
and the prevention of the  
formation of study-circles and other conferences for  
debate, and the employment of every means that  
will make people as much as possible unknown to one another (for familiarity increases mutual con3 fidence);

\[1313b.5\]  
and for the people in the city to be always  
visible and to hang about the palace-gates (for thus  
there would be least concealment about what they  
are doing, and they would get into a habit of being  
humble from always acting in a servile way);

\[1313b.6\]  
and all the other similar devices of Persian and barbarian  
tyranny (for all have the same effect);

\[1313b.7\]  
and to try not to be uninformed  
about any chance utterances or actions of any of the subjects,  
but to have spies  
like the women called 'provocatrices' at Syracuse  
and the 'sharp-ears' that used to be sent out by Hiero  
wherever there was any gathering or conference  
(for when men are afraid of spies of this sort  
they keep a check on their tongues,  
and if they do speak freely are less likely not to be found out);

\[1313b.8\]  
and to set men at variance with one another  
and cause quarrels between friend and friend  
and between the people and the notables  
and among the rich.

\[1313b.9\]  
And it is a device of tyranny to make the subjects poor,  
so that a guard may not be kept,  
and also that the people being busy with their daily affairs  
may not have leisure to plot against their ruler.  
Instances of this are the pyramids in Egypt and the votive offerings  
of the Cypselids,b and the building of the temple of  
Olympian Zeus by the Pisistratidae and of the  
temples at Samos, works of Polycrates  
(for all these undertakings produce the same effect,  
constant occupation and poverty among the subject people);

\[1313b.10\]  
and the levying of taxes, as at Syracuse  
(for in the reign of Dionysius  
the result of taxation used to be that  
in five years men had contributed the whole of their substance).

\[1313b.11\]  
Also the tyrant is a stirrer-up of war,  
with the deliberate purpose of keeping the people busy  
and also of making them constantly in need of a leader.

Also whereas friends are a means of security to royalty,  
it is a mark of a tyrant to be extremely distrustful of his friends,  
on the ground that, while all have the wish,  
these chiefly have the power.

Also the things that occur in connexion with  
the final form of democracy b are all favourable to  
tyranny —

\[1313b.12\]  
dominance of women in the homes,  
in order that they may carry abroad reports against the men,

\[1313b.13\]  
and lack of discipline among the slaves, for the same reason;  
for slaves and women do not plot against tyrants,  
and also,  
if they prosper under tyrannies,  
must feel well-disposed to them,  
and to democracies as well  
(for the common people also wishes to be sole ruler).  
Hence also the flatterer is in honour with both —  
with democracies the demagogue  
(for the demagogue is a flatterer of the people),  
and with the tyrants those who associate with them humbly,  
which is the task of flattery.

\[1314a\]  
In fact owing to this tyranny is a friend of the base;  
for tyrants enjoy being flattered,  
but nobody would ever flatter them if he possessed a free spirit —  
men of character love their ruler, or at all events do not flatter him.
